run_project.sh runs the project, but does take a significant time to run.

this version runs for 10 rather than 100 repeats of simulations to increase the speed.
To run for 100 simulations (in project, please change sims_range at the top of PlotsFinal and integration_Vectorisation_cov_var  to sims_range=c(1,100))

Results and Writeup will be filled when run_project.sh is run
